## Customer Behavior Analysis
Analyzed customer demographics, purchasing patterns, spending behavior, product preferences, time-based trends, and lifecycle behavior.

## Key Insights
- Customer demographic analysis shows that a majority of active customers belong to a limited number of age groups, indicating clear target segments.
- Purchase frequency analysis reveals that a small group of customers accounts for a disproportionately high number of transactions.
- Spending behavior analysis indicates that high-frequency customers also contribute significantly to total revenue, aligning with RFM high-value segments.
- Product preference analysis highlights a concentration of sales around a few top-performing product categories.
- Time-based behavior analysis shows peak purchasing activity during specific periods, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions and campaigns.
- Customer lifecycle analysis indicates that newly acquired customers exhibit lower purchase frequency, while long-term customers demonstrate higher loyalty and spending consistency.
- RFM segmentation successfully distinguishes high-value, loyal, at-risk, and low-value customers, enabling data-driven marketing strategies.
